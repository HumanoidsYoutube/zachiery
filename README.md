# Overview
Zachiery aims to be an incredibly versatile bot; our goal is to have every feature you could ever think of, and some you would never even imagine. The overall vision of Zachiery is to provide the user with a quality product. Unlike many of the bigger Discord bots, HaileyBot will _never_ integrate any pay-to-unlock commands, or anything else that requires monetary compensation in exchange for functionality. We built Zachiery from the ground up on a foundation based on user satisfaction. The user experience is our top priority, because without the userbase, this bot would not exist.
